the dead-man's bell\\nMust toll our wedding; our first hearth\\nMust be the well-paved floor of hell.'\\nThe colour died from out her face,\\nHer eyes like ghostly candles shone;\\nShe cast dread looks about the place,\\nThen clenched her teeth and read right on.\\n'I may not pass the prison door;\\nHere must I rot from day to day,\\nUnless I wed whom I abhor,\\nMy cousin, Blanche of Valencay.\\n'At midnight with my dagger keen,\\nI'll take my life; it must be so.\\nMeet me in hell to-night, my queen,\\nFor weal and woe.'\\nShe laughed although her face was wan,\\nShe girded on her golden belt,\\nShe took her jewelled ivory fan,\\nAnd at her glowing missal knelt.\\nThen rose, 'And am I mad?' she said:\\nShe broke her fan, her belt untied;\\nWith leather girt herself instead,\\nAnd stuck a dagger at her side.\\nShe waited, shuddering in her room,\\nTill sleep had fallen on all the house.\\nShe never flinched; she faced her doom:\\nThey two must sin to keep their vows.\\nThen out into the night she went,\\nAnd, stooping, crept by hedge and tree;\\nHer rose-bush flung a snare of scent,\\nAnd caught a happy memory.\\nShe fell, and lay a minute's space;\\nShe tore the sward in her distress;\\nThe dewy grass refreshed her face;\\nShe rose and ran with lifted dress.\\nShe started like a morn-caught ghost\\nOnce when the moon came out and stood\\nTo watch; the naked road she crossed,\\nAnd dived into the murmuring wood.\\nThe branches snatched her streaming cloak;\\nA live thing shrieked; she made no stay!\\nShe hurried to the trysting-oakâ€”\\nRight well she knew the way.\\nWithout a pause she bared her breast,\\nAnd drove her dagger home and fell,\\nAnd lay like one that takes her rest,\\nAnd died and wakened up in hell.\\nShe bathed her spirit in the flame,\\nAnd near the centre took her post;\\nFrom all sides to her ears there came\\nThe dreary anguish of the lost.\\nThe devil started at her side,\\nComely, and tall, and black as jet.\\n'I am young Malespina's bride;\\nHas he come hither yet?'\\n'My poppet, welcome to your bed.'\\n'Is Malespina here?'\\n'Not he! To-morrow he must wed\\nHis cousin Blanche, my dear!'\\n'You lie, he died with me to-night.'\\n'Not he! it was a plot' ... 'You lie.'\\n'My dear, I never lie outright.'\\n'We died at midnight, he and I.'\\nThe devil went. Without a groan\\nShe, gathered up in one fierce prayer,\\nTook root in hell's midst all alone,\\nAnd waited for him there.\\nShe dared to make herself at home\\nAmidst the wail, the uneasy stir.\\nThe blood-stained flame that filled the dome,\\nScentless and silent, shrouded her.\\nHow long she stayed I cannot tell;\\nBut when she felt his perfidy,\\nShe marched across the floor of hell;\\nAnd all the damned stood up to see.\\nThe devil stopped her at the brink:\\nShe shook him off; she cried, 'Away!'\\n'My dear, you have gone mad, I think.'\\n'I was betrayed: I will not stay.'\\nAcross the weltering deep she ran;\\nA stranger thing was never seen:\\nThe damned stood silent to a man;\\nThey saw the great gulf set between.\\nTo her it seemed a meadow fair;\\nAnd flowers sprang up about her feet\\nShe entered heaven; she climbed the stair\\nAnd knelt down at the mercy-seat.\\nSeraphs and saints with one great voice\\nWelcomed that soul that knew not fear.\\nAmazed to find it could rejoice,\\nHell raised a hoarse, half-human cheer.\"...]"
